This document outlines the known risks and limitations associated with the
Daylight software. It should be presented to users during onboarding and
referenced in the Terms of Service.

Key risks:

- Market risk: Historical simulations are not predictive of future returns.
- Model risk: Monte Carlo, optimization, and AI models rely on assumptions
  that may not hold in real markets.
- Data risk: Third-party data may be incomplete or incorrect.
- Operational risk: Outages, bugs, or misconfigurations can lead to incorrect
  outputs.
- Security risk: Unauthorized access may expose personal or financial data.

Users must acknowledge these risks before using features that process
financial data or offer simulation outputs.
