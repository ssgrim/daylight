# DevOps Issue Template Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Following the successful implementation of issue #112 (Search Infrastructure & Geospatial Indexing), we've created comprehensive DevOps-focused issue templates to ensure all future feature requests include proper planning for infrastructure, security, monitoring, and operational requirements.

## 📁 Templates Created

### 1. Interactive YAML Template
**File:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/devops-feature-request.yml`
- **Format:** GitHub's modern issue form with structured inputs
- **Features:** Dropdown selections, checkboxes, and guided input fields
- **Best For:** Team members who prefer guided forms
- **Validation:** Built-in required field validation

### 2. Markdown Template  
**File:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/devops-feature-request.md`
- **Format:** Traditional markdown template
- **Features:** Complete DevOps checklist and comprehensive planning sections
- **Best For:** Experienced developers who prefer flexible formatting
- **Validation:** Manual completion of all sections

### 3. Detailed Documentation
**File:** `docs/DEVOPS_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Format:** Complete implementation guide and reference
- **Features:** Detailed explanations and best practices
- **Best For:** Template reference and team onboarding

## 🚀 Key Features

Both templates include comprehensive coverage of:

### **Planning & Analysis**
- Business impact assessment
- Technical necessity justification
- Current state analysis
- Dependency mapping

### **Implementation Structure**
- Phased implementation plan
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Performance requirements
- Security & compliance requirements

### **DevOps Integration**
- Infrastructure as Code planning
- CI/CD pipeline updates
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Cost estimation and tracking

### **Quality Assurance**
- Definition of Done checklist
- Testing requirements (unit, integration, performance)
- Security scanning requirements
- Documentation standards

### **Success Measurement**
- Technical metrics
- Business metrics  
- DevOps metrics (deployment frequency, MTTR, etc.)

## 📊 Usage Guidelines

### **For New Issues**
1. Use the interactive YAML template for most feature requests
2. Use the markdown template for complex features requiring detailed planning
3. Reference the documentation template for guidance on each section

### **Required Sections**
- **Overview:** Clear feature description
- **Business Impact:** Why this feature matters
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Specific, measurable requirements
- **Implementation Plan:** Phased approach with milestones
- **Cost Estimation:** Development and infrastructure costs
- **Definition of Done:** Quality gates and completion criteria

### **DevOps Checklist Items**
Every issue must address:
- [ ] Infrastructure requirements planned
- [ ] Security considerations documented
- [ ] Monitoring strategy defined
- [ ] Performance targets set
- [ ] Cost impact assessed
- [ ] Deployment strategy planned
- [ ] Testing strategy comprehensive

## 🎯 Benefits
