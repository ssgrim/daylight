Legal Compliance Guide
======================

Last updated: August 26, 2025

This guide summarizes regulatory considerations for deploying Daylight as a
financial software product.

High-level checklist:

- Determine whether the product constitutes investment advice in target
  jurisdictions. If yes, obtain required licenses or reframe product as
  educational-only.
- Privacy: implement GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable privacy controls.
- Financial data: follow GLBA and related data protection standards where
  applicable.
- Anti-Money Laundering (AML): assess whether AML/KYC controls are required
  for features that handle transactions or custody.
- Consumer protection: include clear risk disclosures and opt-ins for
  experimental features.

Engage local counsel for jurisdiction-specific requirements before production
deployment.
